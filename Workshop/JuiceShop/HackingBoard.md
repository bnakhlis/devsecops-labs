## Find the hacking challanges ##

**These excercises need to be run on OWASP juice web page**

Your first challange is to discover the score-board.


**Score Board**	-> Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page  
<br>
<br>
You missed the link during the initial mapping of the application
There is a URL that leads to the Score Board but it is not hyperlinked to

Knowing it exists, you can simply guess what URL the Score Board might have.  

Alternatively, you can try to find a reference or clue within the parts of the application that are not usually visible in the browser  

> Once you open the Score Board you will see rest of the challanges.
